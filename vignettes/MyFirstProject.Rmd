MyFirstProject is designed to help me make my first steps as an awesome package developer.

## Core functionality
At this point in time, key aspects of the package are:

- `circlearea` for calculating the area of circle, given the radius.

## Using the package
### `circlearea`
Use `circlearea` to calculate the area of cicle given vectors. Note that this does not do any unit management.

```{r}
library(MyFirstProject)
circlearea(2)
circlearea(2:5)
```
